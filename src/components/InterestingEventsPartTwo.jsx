                I once met the CEO of HomeLane, one of India's largest home interior companies, by accident in Bangalore while I was building Interio Square. We didn't have any meaningful conversation at the time, but we exchanged a couple of emails.

                    Before ChatGPT went mainstream, I was already curious about AI and wanted to get involved somehow. So I started cold calling AI startup founders. One of them at GTS AI gave me a small data collection job. I completed it successfully with the help of my friends, hoping it would lead to something bigger or at least help me learn. It didn't lead anywhere in the end but anyway I made a bit of money.

                I once met the Managing Director of DiaSorin India on a flight. We ended up talking the entire journey, mostly about the wood business. I shared my thoughts on quitting college and told him about my father's furniture company. A week or two later, he called me out of the blue and said, "Send me some furniture $3,000 worth for my home." No meetings, just a phone call. That moment meant a lot to me. At just 17, I was able to earn someone's trust just through a one-hour flight conversation. It gave me real confidence that I could sell and build relationships.
